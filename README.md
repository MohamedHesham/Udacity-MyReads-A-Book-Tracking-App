# MyReads Project

MyReads is a Single Page App that allows you to select and categorize books you have read, are currently reading, or want to read.

## The goal of the project

Add interactivity (React code) to the app by refactoring the static code.

## How to run

1. Clone this repository to your desktop and navigate to the project directory.
2. Install all project dependencies with `npm install`
3. Launch the app via local server with `npm start`

## Backend Server - important

The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## Contributing

The project was based on the starter code for Udacity students: https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter. Starter project This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
